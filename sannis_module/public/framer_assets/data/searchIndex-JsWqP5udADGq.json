THE DECISION OF THE ARBITRATOR SHALL BE FINAL AND BINDING ON THE PARTIES, AND JUDGMENT ON THE AWARD RENDERED BY THE ARBITRATOR MAY BE ENTERED IN ANY COURT HAVING JURISDICTION THEREOF.","You and the Foundation Parties agree to submit any disputes arising under these Terms of Use, or in connection with your use of the Functionality, including disputes arising from or concerning the interpretation, violation, invalidity, non-performance, or termination of these Terms of Use, to final and binding arbitration administered by the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (“HKIAC”) under the HKIAC Administered Arbitration Rules (“HKIAC Rules”) in force when the Notice of Arbitration (“Notice of Arbitration”) is submitted, applying Hong Kong Law. The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in English.","If there is a conflict between this Arbitration Agreement and the HKIAC Rules, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control, unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The form of the arbitration hearing (i.e., in person or virtual) and its location will be determined in accordance with applicable HKIAC Rules.  The fees and costs associated with arbitration will be those set forth in the HKIAC applicable fee schedules.  To learn more about the HKIAC Rules and how to begin an arbitration, you may call HKIAC at (852) 2525-2381, email HKIAC at adr@hkiac.org, and/or visit HKIAC’s website at www.hkiac.org.","Any award by the arbitrator shall be in writing and will be final and binding on all parties, subject to any limited right to appeal provided by the HKIAC Rules and/or Hong Kong law.  Judgment upon any award in arbitration may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.","In the event the HKIAC is unable to preside over the dispute, you and the Foundation Parties agree to submit any disputes arising under the binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association-International Centre for Dispute Resolution (“AAA-ICDR”) pursuant to its Consumer Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures, Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures, and/or Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules (together, the “AAA-ICDR Rules”), as applicable, and pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement.  The form of any such AAA-ICDR arbitration hearing (i.e., in person or virtual) and its location will be determined in accordance with applicable AAA-ICDR Rules.  The fees and costs associated with arbitration will be those set forth in AAA-ICDR applicable fee schedules.  To learn more about the AAA-ICDR Rules and how to begin an arbitration, you may call AAA-ICDR at 800-778-7879, email AAA-ICDR at CustomerService@adr.org, or visit AAA-ICDR’s website at www.adr.org. If an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this Arbitration Agreement cannot be enforced as to a particular claim for relief or remedy (such as declaratory relief), then that claim or remedy (and only that claim or remedy) shall be severed and must be brought in court and any other claims must be arbitrated.  Any claims or causes of action seeking relief not subject to arbitration under applicable law shall be stayed in a court of competent jurisdiction pending completion of the arbitration of the remaining claims to the maximum extent permitted by law.","Delegation of Arbitrability.  For the avoidance of doubt, this Arbitration Agreement includes an agreement by you and the Foundation Parties that the authority to determine the threshold question of whether a dispute or claim between you and the Foundation Parties is subject to arbitration—that is, whether such dispute or claim is arbitrable—shall rest exclusively with the arbitrator and not with a court, except as otherwise set forth expressly herein.","Mass Arbitration.  If more than 25 arbitration demands of a substantially similar nature, alleging substantially similar or identical claims or causes of action, are filed against us by the same law firm or collection of legal counsel or law firms, the claims shall not be administered by HKIAC under its rules and shall instead be administered by the AAA-ICDR pursuant to the AAA-ICDR Rules and this Arbitration Agreement.  AAA-ICDR shall (i) group the arbitration demands into batches of no more than 50 demands per group; and (ii) provide for resolution of each group or batch as a consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees and a single arbitrator assigned per group or batch.  You and the Foundation Parties agree to cooperate in good faith with AAA-ICDR to implement the aforementioned protocol for mass, collective, and/or batch arbitrations with regard to resolution, fees, and administration.  To the extent AAA-ICDR does not enforce these batching procedures, the parties agree that AAA-ICDR shall endeavor to assign multiple proceedings to a single, mutually agreeable merits arbitrator.","Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure.  In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or in relation to these Terms, or in connection with your use of the Functionality, the parties shall first attempt to resolve the dispute amicably through good-faith negotiations. You must notify us of a dispute by emailing us at feedback@chainspark.foundation and including information sufficient for us to confirm that you are a customer of Trojan and/or one or more of the Foundation Parties. We may notify you of a dispute by emailing any email address you have provided to us. Such notification must describe the nature and basis of the dispute and set forth the specific relief sought (“Notice”).","If the dispute set out in a Notice is not resolved by negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date of notification, you and/or the Foundation Parties may elect to refer the dispute to arbitration within sixty (60) days thereafter. Upon such election, you and the Foundation Parties agree to submit to arbitration, as set forth above. Once you and/or a Foundation Party has elected to arbitrate, any related court proceedings shall be stayed, except for actions seeking interim or injunctive relief permitted under this section. ALL PARTIES AGREE THAT THE INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURE IS A CONDITION PRECEDENT THAT MUST BE SATISFIED BEFORE INITIATING ANY ARBITRATION PROCEEDING AGAINST ANY OTHER PARTY.  To the extent the parties dispute whether this condition precedent has been satisfied, this dispute shall not be decided by an arbitrator in arbitration and shall instead be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction prior to the initiation of any arbitration.  The parties agree the court shall have the authority to stay any arbitration (including the payment of any associated fees) pending resolution of any such dispute.","Confidentiality of Arbitration.  All negotiations and arbitration proceedings related to any dispute (including, but not limited to, any settlements, awards, and the fact that they have taken place) shall be kept confidential by the parties, their representatives, and any participants in the arbitration, except as may be required by law or to enforce any settlement or arbitration award.","Claims Not Subject to Arbitration. Notwithstanding the above, you and/or the Foundation Parties may elect to:","(1) litigate a claim in small claims court (or similar court) of your city or county of residence if the amount at issue is within the jurisdictional limits of that court.  If the dispute is commenced as an arbitration by one party, the other party shall have 30 days after service to elect to proceed in small claims court instead.  In the event of such an election, the arbitration will be dismissed, and either party may commence the claim in small claims court.","(2) bring an action a court of competent jurisdiction that asserts legal and/or equitable claims for patent infringement or invalidity, copyright infringement, piracy, moral rights violations, trademark infringement, trade secret misappropriation, and/or any other unlawful use of intellectual property.  This includes actions seeking interim or injunctive relief on—and only on—any such claims.","OPT-OUT OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.  You may opt out of the Arbitration Agreement within 30 days after your first use of the Functionality or availability of this Agreement to Arbitrate, whichever is later, by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to optout@trojan.com with the subject line “ARBITRATION OPT-OUT.”  To be valid, your notice of your decision to opt out must include your full name and the email address you used to create your Account.  If you do not opt-out within the 30-day timeframe, then the Arbitration Agreement shall be binding.","YOU AND THE FOUNDATION PARTIES AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION UNDER THESE TERMS OF USE SHALL BE RESOLVED SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.

The achievement pushes Solana’s total RWA value above $800 million, up more than 200% year-to-date, with over 100,000 unique holders now active across the ecosystem.","Originally launched on Ethereum in early 2025, BUIDL expanded to Solana in April to leverage its low-cost, high-speed architecture for institutional liquidity operations. The Solana deployment now represents a growing share of the fund’s total $2.8 billion AUM, as liquidity rotates from congested networks toward faster settlement layers. The fund offers stable yields of 4–5% APY with full SEC registration and onchain redemption, bridging traditional market compliance with blockchain accessibility.","The milestone reinforces Solana’s position as a leading RWA infrastructure. Institutions such as Ondo Finance, Superstate, and Galaxy have joined the wave, pushing total tokenized Treasuries on Solana to record levels. As the tokenized finance market approaches $50 billion by year-end, Solana’s combination of throughput, cost-efficiency, and stablecoin depth continues to attract both Wall Street capital and onchain innovators.","As this institutional momentum deepens, Trojan stands as the interface where onchain liquidity becomes actionable.

The token, issued by Anchorage Digital Bank, will integrate with Western Union’s new Digital Asset Network, designed to connect fiat and digital currency flows across its 400,000 retail locations worldwide. Solana’s high-speed architecture and low-cost settlement make it an ideal foundation for near-instant, low-fee remittances, targeting a market that still pays an average of 6–7% in transfer costs.","Set to launch in the first half of 2026, USDPT aims to modernize cross-border payments for Western Union’s more than 100 million customers in over 200 countries. The network will allow users to send, receive, spend, and cash out stablecoins directly, combining onchain efficiency with traditional infrastructure reach. Company leadership calls it a “natural extension” of Western Union’s mission to make financial services universally accessible, extending a legacy that began with the telegraph to a blockchain-powered future.","This initiative also signals a broader shift toward institutional use of Solana for real-world payments. Following the Genius Act’s federal framework for stablecoins earlier this year, the move positions Solana as a primary rail for regulated digital finance.

Bitwise’s BSOL Staking ETF began trading on the NYSE, alongside new spot ETFs from Canary Capital for Hedera (HBAR) and Litecoin (LTC). The development follows recent SEC procedural reforms that streamline approvals for commodity-based ETFs, a move analysts see as pivotal for bringing digital assets closer to traditional markets.","Institutional participation is accelerating. Fidelity has expanded Solana trading access across its brokerage platforms, and several research groups now project Solana’s price could target the $500 range if inflows persist. Sentiment across social channels remains strongly bullish, with traders describing ETF listings as a critical step in legitimizing Solana’s ecosystem.","The timing coincides with Solana’s DeFi total value locked reaching all-time highs, as new memecoin launches and retail activity surge.

But in essence, both Buys and Sells are just swaps. You have an asset or token, someone else has a different asset or token, and you exchange them at an agreed upon ratio.","For an easy example let’s pretend you have $200 USD (or equivalent stablecoin) and I have 1 SOL. You and I agree the 1 SOL is worth $200 USD. So we exchange. It could be said in this scenario that I “buy” $200 USD or that I “sell” 1 SOL. And vice versa for yourself.","In this example, there are only the two of us, so we are each the best offer for each other. But in a market with tens, thousands, or even millions of participants, there are going to be many competing offers, at various prices, for various sizes of exchange. All these different prices and amounts and offers make up what is called the order book. When you execute a Market Order, Trojan reaches out, searching all the orderbooks, and in a fraction of a second, finds the best offer that is out there of someone willing to swap with you, and makes it happen. All with a single click.","Market Orders are for when you can’t, or won’t, wait. Sometimes opportunities will appear and the window for taking advantage is only seconds. Executing rapidly can be the defining factor in winning or losing trades. Trojan’s terminal processes Market Orders through its proprietary routing engine, identifying the best available liquidity and sending your transaction accordingly. This means fewer failed trades, tighter spreads, and faster confirmations, even during high volatility.","Equally important, Market Orders can ensure you get out of a position without waiting for limit conditions to be met. Sometimes the trend shifts very suddenly and a quick “sell” click can ensure you walk with profits rather than losses.","But remember, the price you get with a Market Order is dictated by whatever others are already offering. You’re simply telling them, in that instant, that you’ll agree to their price.","Market Orders inevitably require that you are in front of a screen. But maybe you have other things to do, like shower or sleep, and you don’t want to close out your position yet. If you have to be away from the charts, that’s when you put in Limit Orders. But we’ll save those for another article as it’s a much deeper and wider function.","So, the short of it is that Market Orders are for immediate action. You don’t get to dictate price, you take whatever other market participants are already offering, but sometimes it’s the best choice. Learning to discern the difference is a skill acquired with practice.","When crypto is measured in milliseconds, you can rely on Trojan’s Market Orders to let you act without hesitation and get you the best pricing out there.","With Bitcoin roots stretching back to 2016 and “full‑time” status since 2021, Silo blends data‑driven writing with cryptonative expertise.

Set price or time-based triggers to buy, sell, or accumulate automatically, reducing emotion, minimizing slippage, and maintaining consistent execution across volatile markets.","The term Limit Order actually covers a very broad range of types of orders, but at the core, it just means any order triggered by an “event”. The event can be passage of time, price reaching a predetermined level, or even another wallet buying or selling. The central theme is one of preplanning rather than reaction.","Here we cover the two most basic Limit Orders on Trojan:","Price-based triggers (known simply as Limit Orders)","Time-based triggers (known as Dollar-Cost Averaging or DCA)","We assume you read, or already understand the content of, our Market Orders post. If not, it is worth giving it a skim before proceeding.","Basic Limit Orders are very simple to grasp. A trader believes the price of a token will move lower before increasing again. Therefore, they put in an order to buy at that lower price. If the price goes there, the swap takes place. If not, it doesn’t. And vice versa for sells.","Here’s an example: GAMBOL coin is trading at $2. You think the structure suggests it is overbought, so you put in a limit buy order for 1000 coins at $1. Price then drops to 90¢, your order gets filled on the way down, you own 1000 GAMBOL. You then put in a limit sell order for $1.50. Price rises back to $2 and on the way up your sell triggers and you now have $1500.","A trader who had market bought at $2 would not have seen a gain, and would have in fact had to stomach a >50% draw down in the process. Whereas a limit order allowed the trader to capture a gain, only endure a small drawdown, and to give attention to other matters while waiting for the market to come to their price.","The potential downside to utilizing a price-based Limit Order rather than a Market Order is that price may never reach your expectations (i.e. missed entries or missed exits).","A subset of these price-based Limit Orders is the Stop-Loss. The Stop-Loss is just a limit sell order that is triggered if the price drops to a predefined level. A Stop-Loss helps to “limit” the amount of “loss” a trade can possibly incur (ignoring the possibilities of slippage and liquidity rugging). With Trojan, users can simultaneously post Take-Profit and Stop-Loss orders creating a pre-set risk profile. With Autosell enabled, this is even simpler.","Using the above example: Let’s say you bought the same amount of GAMBOL at the same $1 price point and you were only willing to actually risk $200. Putting a Stop-Loss at 80¢ means, should the token price decrease that far, your position would be offloaded and you would only lose the $200. Risk limitation.","DCA (or Dollar-Cost Average) Orders are limit orders designed around the idea of accumulation or distribution over time. The general idea is that, at fixed time intervals, for a user-determined period of time, the trader will buy or sell a fixed amount.","Continuing with our example: Let’s say you want to spend $1000 on GAMBOL tokens. You set up a DCA of 10 buys total, 1 buy every minute. This means each buy will be $100 (no matter what the price is), and the total time to run the DCA will be 9 minutes (the first buy happens immediately).","NOTE: Because DCA is a time-based and not a price-based limit order, the price at which purchases are made will vary.","DCA serves a couple of unique purposes for the active trader:","Flattens the effect of volatility on average purchase price","Avoids causing sudden rapid spikes or dips in price from large purchases","Decreases likelihood of MEV attacks or slippage eating purchases or profits","While DCA can, and is used in a variety of situations, it is particularly useful (on the buy side) for tokens you expect to have significant upside and are planning to buy heavily into, or (on the sell side) tokens you hold a significant position in and want to offload without destroying the chart or in small increments on the way up.","DCA is not a particularly useful tool for microcaps or fresh launches unless the buy/sell interval is extremely short. The volatility and lifespan generally do not align well with DCA strategies.","Limit Orders are an exceptionally useful tool for active traders. So far we have only covered the common price-based Limit Order, the Stop-Loss, and DCA Orders, but there are several more sub-types of limit orders, which we will cover in a later article.","Trojan provides all these and much more in a user-friendly interface built to give traders of all skillsets and experience levels the edge they need to keep calm and win big in the market.","With Bitcoin roots stretching back to 2016 and “full‑time” status since 2021, Silo blends data‑driven writing with cryptonative expertise.

Reports indicate nearly $3.5 million was removed from the liquidity pool during the crash. $1.5 million was subsequently reinjected into the LP.","Savvy traders who caught wind of the posts by Mr. Adams on X had a brief window to capture some portion of the near 600% price rise before the ATH. The event underscores the volatility of meme coin launches on Solana, where trading volume and liquidity dynamics can shift within seconds.","Morgan Stanley filed an S-1 registration with the SEC for a spot Solana ETF, signaling a significant step toward mainstream institutional participation. The filing follows similar approvals for Bitcoin ETFs and growing inflows into existing Solana ETFs (Bitwise, Grayscale, Fidelity, and others) which reached $41.1 million last week and now total over $1 billion in AUM.","Analysts suggest that Morgan Stanley’s entry could increase liquidity, visibility, and credibility for Solana as a primary onchain asset class.","X (formerly Twitter) plans to introduce Smart Cashtags for Solana tokens, enabling live charts, key metrics, and potentially related news feeds to appear directly in posts. The update may accelerate retail awareness and memecoin trading activity. It may also bring a measure of increased security as the tickers can be tied directly to specific contract addresses preventing some of the rampant confusion from copy-cat and “vamping” launches.","The integration bridges social visibility and onchain activity, reinforcing Solana’s presence across real-time trading networks. Combined with Trojan's in-app X-tracker feed, a whole new level of speed to execution may soon be realized.","A new $70,000 Solana Privacy Hackathon opened on the 12th and will run through January 30. The event focuses on privacy infrastructure such as private payments and encrypted trading. It comes amid broader privacy discussions in crypto, following the rapid rise and broadly discussed departures at Zcash and a renewed interest in privacy coins like Monero, which recently hit an all-time high, despite regional restrictions.","The pace of Solana’s development continues to accelerate, spanning memes, institutional products, and technical innovation. Each advancement pushes onchain markets toward higher speed and transparency.

With a Senate markup set for the end of January, the outcome could reshape the landscape for onchain markets and institutional participation.","The Clarity Act, formally titled the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025, is a bipartisan proposal introduced in the 119th Congress to create a coherent regulatory structure for cryptocurrencies and digital assets. It addresses a core uncertainty that has defined the U.S. market for years: Which tokens fall under securities law and which qualify as commodities?","Supporters believe it will end “regulation by enforcement,” unlock institutional adoption, and provide a path for innovation. Critics argue it could favor larger incumbents or fail to provide sufficient consumer protections. The bill is scheduled for Senate Banking Committee markup at the end of January, a key moment for the industry.","The bill was introduced in May 2025 by Representatives Patrick McHenry (R-NC) and Glenn Thompson (R-PA), joined by Democratic co-sponsors including Ritchie Torres (D-NY). It builds on previous efforts such as FIT21 and the Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible","Financial Innovation Act.","After advancing through the House Financial Services and Agriculture Committees, the bill passed the House on July 17, 2025, with a bipartisan vote of 294 to 134. It is now before the Senate Banking Committee with backing from Senators Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY). If approved in markup, it could proceed to a full Senate vote and reconciliation with the House version.","The Clarity Act follows the earlier Stablecoin Genius Act but is broader in scope, focusing on overall market structure and regulatory coordination between agencies.","The Clarity Act’s primary goal is to define how digital assets are classified and overseen. Core elements of the bill include:","Creates a structured test to determine whether a digital asset is a security or a commodity. Sufficiently “mature” assets such as Bitcoin would be considered “digital commodities” under CFTC oversight, while token offerings may remain under SEC jurisdiction until decentralization criteria are met.","These Digital Assets would have a two-tier categorical breakdown:","Digital Commodity - (under CFTC) - digital assets “intrinsically linked” to a blockchain system. Their value being derived from its use, function, incentives, etc.","Investment Contract Asset - (under SEC initially) - subset of Digital Commodity that begins as an investment contract (think ICO) used to raise capital. Primary offerings treated as securities. Later, the asset itself can become a pure Digital Commodity.","Grants the CFTC exclusive authority over spot markets for digital commodities. Exchanges, brokers, and custodians would require registration and compliance with anti-fraud, anti-manipulation, and consumer protection standards. You’ll start to see the terms “digital commodity exchanges” (DCEs) and “digital commodity brokers” popping up.","Establishes federal standards for stablecoin issuers, with debate ongoing between banks seeking stricter reserve rules and crypto firms advocating flexibility to preserve innovation. A big move here is that banks would be able to hold stables (aka “payment stablecoins”) without treating them as liabilities. That means they can basically treat them like holding cash.","In part, the bill protects users’ rights to self-custody. This means the ability to retain your own funds in hardware and software wallets as well as to engage in peer-to-peer transactions; a fundamental element of the original vision that birthed cryptocurrencies.

It could drive institutional inflows, validate digital asset classifications, and expand regulated onchain markets. In other words, bring a flood of liquidity and participants onchain creating demand for high-speed, non-custodial platforms. Some expect acceleration of the launch of altcoin ETFs and compliant token products with further deregulation.","For utility tokens such as SOL, XRP, and HBAR, clearer classification could enhance enterprise and DeFi adoption by reducing legal ambiguity. Failure to pass, however, could prolong regulatory uncertainty and dampen U.S. competitiveness relative to global crypto hubs.","Proponents, including industry groups and policymakers, argue that the bill balances innovation and consumer protection while creating a foundation for long-term growth.","Critics counter that it may overextend CFTC jurisdiction or favor established institutions.

Explore key differences in automation, rewards, UI design, and usability to decide which platform fits your strategy.","Silo","January 14, 2026","Onchain Exchange","DeFi","Solana","Onchain trading moves fast, and picking the right terminal matters. This head-to-head review of Trojan vs. GMGN breaks down automation, rewards, and usability to show which Solana platform gives traders the better edge.","Onchain crypto trading is one step short of a battlezone. It’s no wonder they call it the Trenches. But in any fight, a winner needs a well-honed edge.","Seasoned traders learned the pain of navigating expensive, inaccurate, and often sluggish DEXs to accomplish basic onchain swaps. Today the battle is different, and the new weapons of the onchain warriors are hyperpowerful, non-custodial webapps reminiscent of CEXs, but beefed up with tools only available for the web3 environment.","Though, for a time, new platforms seemed to be launching daily, this influx has slowed in recent times and only a few true players remain. Deciding between them can be complicated and the wrong decision can be costly.","This is the second in our short series placing the competition up against Trojan Terminal. Our intent is to be as honest and objective as possible by providing you pros and cons, on both sides so that you can make the best decision for where to engage in your trading activity.","Today it’s GMGN. Hope you got your boots laced tight.","Launched for Solana trading in early 2024, GMGN was one of the earliest to enter the onchain webapp trading space. Their lifetime trade volume is about $3 billion, lifetime trades about 100 million, and users about 1 million. This barely puts them in the top 10 (numbers-wise) of competition against telegram trading bots, although they rank in the top 3 or 4 of webapps. Although they found a high volume spike after incorporating the Binance Smart Chain, this was short-lived and for our purposes we will be focused on Solana only though they are multichain.","GMGN charges the industry standard 1% on all executed trades. They do not have any cashback features as far as we could discover and we’ll discuss their referral program later (the short version is, it’s pretty limited).","GMGN does a lot. Which sounds generous, but many if not most of the positives get lost in the mix of the construction. It’s as though there are many ideas, but an absence of a clear method of implementation to make it usable. So we did some digging, and we’re going to present what we found that may be of interest to users first on the positive end of the spectrum and then on the negative.","Anyone who’s deep in the trenches swapping memes knows that new launches and metas tend to vamp attacked by people launching copycat tokens with the same name and/or picture. But crypto tends to value the first mover and so quickly finding the original can be important. GMGN allows you to hover over the coin’s image and get an immediate rundown of how many times the image has been used, links to the other coins, and even a first user tag. It’s not infallible though. We found multiple instances where the detector failed.","If you’ve ever wondered what the origin story of the coin is, GMGN has a hover-over feature that provides an AI generated text about where the meme came from; be it an X post, a news event, or just another niche internet joke. For the uninitiated or the folks seeking to keep abreast of viral trends it probably has value, but for the vast majority of trenchers swapping narratives it will probably only serve as another piece to crowd the interface.","Wanna vamp a meta? Got a good idea and you want to launch a coin? Maybe you don’t even have an idea, just a word. Cooking launches coins directly within the interface. You can use their AI to generate a ticker and image. It really is about as low effort as you can imagine. Find a coin that exists, enter Cooking, and it will autopopulate with the image and ticker of that coin so you can dilute the market more…if that’s your thing.","On any launched token you can access stats on the devs themselves. It shows the number of coins launched, the successful/failed migration percentage, and the full list of their coins. While this might be a useful feature for being able to decide on what tokens to purchase, there are so many icons in the UI that being able to make quick use of such a feature can be difficult.","GMGN includes a native token rent recapture interface. On Solana, when new tokens are bought, a small amount of SOL is locked up. This fee can be recaptured, and, for users who trade large numbers of coins, the collective amount can really add up. This native burn / account closure feature enables users to reclaim that idle SOL without needing to access third parties.","Just as sure as each platform provides unique or beneficial tools, they have places where they come up short, lacking quality in their build or failing to provide proper tooling. GMGN is no different.","GMGN does not have a tiered system of referrals (unlike Trojan). Rather, you only earn from your direct referrals in a sliding scale of their trading volume. This means that if your referrals bring someone new on, you see no benefit. Such limitations can severely hamper the lasting passive income opportunities for users. Should one or two traders fall away or change their wallet addresses it could cost large earnings losses. A broader circle buffers against such common occurrences.","Crypto in general and meme coins in particular move very fast. Automation comes in clutch when you’re trying to juggle tens or even hundreds of entries. How much better is it if you can simply predefine your risk for purchases and know that the orders will be handled? GMGN requires that you set up limit orders for every…single…token…you buy. Painful.","Timely data is a must for anyone who trades actively. But what good is immediate data that you can’t digest quickly? Or what good is a trading platform that ceaselessly bombards you visually, so that you cannot focus and make the best decisions? Granting that there are preferences in everything, we find the UI of GMGN to feel cluttered and overly-stimulating, fine for a casino, but not the ideal conditions for making millisecond financial decisions.","Imagine being handed an incredibly complex piece of equipment and all the directions for operating it are vague, disorganized, and at times completely illogical. This is how we found the GMGN documentation. Attempting to understand even some basic activities on the platform by reading through the gitbook was a futile effort. Platforms have a duty to help their users understand the products they develop.","This may be a small point of contention, but GMGN requires users to establish a 2FA binding in order to be able to withdraw or transfer funds. Why is this an issue? Because they don’t inform the user that this will be the case until after they deposit. A truly non-custodial platform has no control and no access to user funds. Blocking withdrawals until a user links in a third-party tool, while perhaps beneficial for security, reveals they have control over user assets. Granted, you can export the private key for the wallets (which defeats the purpose) but this requires potentially exposing your pk, which is a security risk in and of itself.","While there are other issues that we could discuss (tiered tool availability, visual bugs, etc.) we chose to try and focus on what would be likely to be the most stand out issues for new or experienced traders trying to select a daily driver.","Trojan develops exceptional onchain trading tools. Our new terminal takes things into the next era and is brought to you by the same core team behind Trojan on Solana. We brought everything we learned through the building and development of the most popular Telegram trading bot in crypto and refined that knowledge into this new onchain exchange (OEX).","Trojan charges a flat 1% fee on all completed trades, but there are cashback and referral rewards incentives that diminish that net cost for users along with an entirely novel gamified engagement and trading incentives program.","As per our normal format we’re going to kind of take things in reverse order from the way they were presented for GMGN and talk about where we fill in the gaps they leave behind and then hit the reverse.","One thing that has always set Trojan apart from our competition is the depth and breadth of how much we give back to our users. Shared growth often plays as a marketing tactic, but we truly mean it. From our pioneering 5-tier referral network to the inclusion of cashback, and now with the introduction of an all new rewards and referral program, no one in the business treats their customers like we do. Our entire model is to build tools that help you succeed. When you win with us, we win together.","Truly one of the most useful tools in all of crypto trading is Autosell. Being able to predefine your risk tolerances and know that once you buy your stop-loss and take-profit orders are in place with no extra clicking and no need to perch over the charts frees you from emotional decision making and lets you pursue other opportunities. Trojan was the first to ever bring this feature to Solana and remains the best execution around.","We at Trojan know that you are likely going to be spending hours and hours (for some of you 10-15 hours) a day on our terminal. Staring at any screen for that long can be both straining and tiresome. To this end we have scrutinized over every pixel placement, organized and reorganized every element, and sought to eliminate everything that would not hone your edge. We are, at heart, traders like you. We see the same pain points, we feel the same frustrations when searching for data or tools, we feel the same visual fatigue from a million flashing lights and icons. We built this terminal for you.","Hand-in-hand with a UI/UX that makes sense is a manual that helps you, as either a first-timer or a full-timer, understand and use our product to its fullest. An entire team has been dedicated to the design and logical flow of our documentation. Every step, every element, every feature is presented in a straightforward, obvious, logical fashion. Tools are cross-linked and easily searchable to ease understanding. And should you ever come across something you still can’t get a handle on, we provide 24/7 real human being support.","Trojan does not control user funds. You want to withdraw, withdraw. You want to distribute, distribute. You want to deposit, deposit. All the wallets are yours. You have,  functionally, limitless autonomy over your funds. With freedom comes responsibility, but my friend, that’s what crypto was always about. Personal sovereignty over your wealth.","We’re always refining, always seeking to incorporate and develop the next evolution of onchain tools. So, while we strive after perfection, there may be some things we don’t have yet or haven’t yet fine-tuned sufficiently to meet our standards.","If you’re trading in the trenches and looking to understand what a coin is, where it came from, what it’s all about we kind of figure you’re probably not that concerned about speed and have the time to research. We have provided a direct google image search when you click the image for the token, which will aid those investigations, but AI summary blocks currently feel like nothing more than a distraction.","Trojan specializes in trading infrastructure. And while we love the trenches, are deep in them ourselves, we don’t currently see the vamping of metas, the launching of new coins, or the further filling of an already quite busy arena to be our business model currently. The last thing we want to do is distract our users when they are already in the midst of trying to make split-second trading decisions.","While Trojan offers both image and name reuse indicators, and the ability for users to pull up the (at times very loooong) list of previous tokens, what we don’t currently have is the OG coin highlighted. Why not? The first coin is usually seen as the best or most important in crypto, you say. Well, yes and no. In larger markets and deep history, this has historically been the case, but in memes this often doesn’t matter much. It really ends up just being who has volume, liquidity, and community.","While the Trojan on Solana bot had this feature which allowed you to recapture token rents and burn unwanted coins natively, our terminal does not have this…yet. Being able to clear out the dross and unwanted or zeroed out tokens is definitely a useful tool and one that we will be looking to onboard.","One of the contrasts between Trojan and GMGN in UI/UX is definitely the fact that we have chosen to “nest” the less important information. The truly useful and immediately necessary data that shapes the user’s decision to invest in fresh launches is put at the forefront. Metrics that are useful, but that buyers can either live without or are more likely to use for research or investigating more established coins is set one or two clicks deep. Trojan has taken great pains to strip away distractions without eliminating beneficial toolkits. GMGN just generally puts everything in your face all the time.","Yes. It’s Trojan. But don’t check out on us just yet. There may be some specific instances where users would prefer GMGN and since you’ve made it this far, you might as well see the end.","First, our honest assessment of GMGN:","They have multichain.","They have a large number of data streams and tools","Their UI/UX is incredibly crowded and full of distractions","Their rewards program is constrained to only direct referrals","They have a native coin burner and launcher","They have no Autosell automation","Their documentation is a nightmare","So, yeah. We think Trojan is the best choice for nearly everyone, but we admit there may be some outlying situations where that isn’t the case. Here’s a table that outlines the major points for anyone who hates to read:","Trojan","GMGN","Want Autosell","Yes","Want a Comprehensive Tool Set","Need in-app Coin Launcher and Token Burns","Want a Multi-tier Referral Program","Want Clear Documentation","Want a Clean, Well-Organized UI/UX","While at first glance it might seem that the gap between GMGN and Trojan doesn’t seem that broad, once you actually spend some time working with both platforms, looking at what they each offer, and testing the limits…well the gulf widens dramatically.","Trojan is more than just a cut above what is currently available. The amount of time and attention that has gone into building the new terminal shows in every facet, every page, every click. Our OEX is built by traders, for traders.","With Bitcoin roots stretching back to 2016 and “full‑time” status since 2021, Silo blends data‑driven writing with cryptonative expertise.

Narratives gain viral life on social media. Trojan’s X-Tracker links the terminal to X, surfacing live posts, trader sentiment, and mentions tied to the largest accounts. By correlating social data with onchain activity, traders can identify when a narrative is forming and before it becomes visible on charts or scanners.","Traders struggle to use X to actively track narratives. It does not auto-refresh, does not provide a rolling feed of new posts. This means you either rely on third party software or constantly spend time reloading. Either way, the moment you find something worth moving on, you have to jump to a separate platform to execute a trade.","Trojan’s X-Tracker, on the other hand, provides a real-time stream of a customizable series of accounts. Docked at the side of the terminal, users only need to watch for valuable posts and click Quick Buy on any new worthwhile launches in the Trenches interface. Traders who identify sentiment early gain positioning advantages before liquidity reacts.","Users can refine feeds to focus on top traders, influential accounts, or key online leaders that are driving momentum. Some key points of analysis might include:","Post frequency and engagement","Keyword or trend velocity","High-powered account involvement","A well-curated feed, combined with wallet tracking, quality terminal filtering, and tuned Auto Sell presets can give traders an exceptional edge on the market.","X-Tracker enables users to convert social data into actionable trades.

Traders can organize strategies, distribute or consolidate funds, and execute trades across all wallets at once, combining flexibility with precise strategy management.","A Multi-wallet system, in general, means an UI/UX which allows a single user to control more than one wallet (usually ~10 concurrently) within a single interface. Some such interfaces, like Trojanhttps://trojan.com/trade’s terminal, allow a user to both access and simultaneously trade with multiple wallets from a single interface.","Each “wallet” is a distinct Solana address, having its own private key. Within the Trojan UI, users are given the flexibility to establish completely independent strategies for each wallet from a single account. That means different Autosell settings, different gas, tip, and priority amounts, and completely different holdings profiles are possible.","Multi-Wallet can be viewed as a “management layer” inside Trojan’s terminal.","Imagine you have several tactics you wish to manage within the market: long-term bluechip positions, speculative mid-term plays, and quick-flip meme coin trades. You want to keep these holdings segregated so that you can keep your attention focused on the most active movers, but you don’t want to have to switch between wallet providers and platforms to view activity or take action.","With Trojan, you can see the value of your entire portfolio at a glance. But, you can also select a single wallet to inspect the performance and value of a subset of your trading strategy.","Trojan’s Multi-wallet interface also provides a number of additional tools including, but not limited to:","Distribute - send funds from a single address to multiple addresses","Consolidate - draw funds from multiple addresses into a single address","Bundle Buy/Sell - buy or sell from multiple wallets simultaneously with one click","The discerning and organized trader can easily keep strategies compartmentalized for simple analyses, while also managing risk and running experiments.","Multi-wallet transforms account management into precision activity and indexing.

Learn to identify new launches, understand how top traders think, and choose where to trade for the best results. From the speed and cost benefits of Solana to the unmatched execution of Trojan’s Terminal, this guide gives you the roadmap to play the memes and win.","Meme coins are everywhere. Chat is making bands on PENGU, press releases are talking about Fartcoin, and DOGE is probably getting an ETF. They hook our attention because they’re fun or weird or edge, but honestly, watching a coin's price surge, seeing it break all-time high after all-time high; that hits like dopamine.","But. It’s also confusing. Top meme coins hit billions in market cap, but by then you worry you’re buying the top. New tokens constantly appear in the feed, but which ones will run? You want to get in, get profit, and not get rekt; so where do you start?","First step, choose a chain. Solana has high transaction speeds, low fees, and is currently the king for meme coin launches and trades, so that’s our focus. Next, you need a trading platform. We'll cover your options below, but for trading memes, there really is nothing better than Trojan. So if memes and money sounds like a tasty mix, pull up a seat.","Meme coins (or \"memecoins\") are digital assets inspired by:","Internet culture memes - think DOGE, PEPE, and CHILLGUY","Cultural trends - GIGA and Tokabu qualify","Famous personalities - Moo Deng and TRUMP are examples","Passing occurrences - news stories, Musk tweets, etc.","Literally any other idea or event that someone thinks might grab attention","Even derivatives of existing memes can run to insane valuations (Shiba Inu).","Generally, new meme coins represent a mere passing interest in a topic. They are created, flourish briefly, and fade away. Most were never serious to begin with. But a few stick around and bring hodlers unbelievable gains. These often get tagged as \"cabal tokens,\" a label applied when retail traders suspect a coin is bought, held, and shilled by insider groups and influencers. And, while this sounds bad, it can result in a longer life and greater upside.","Solana’s microscopically low transaction fees make high frequency trading worthwhile. A common strategy in the memecoin market is to get in early with small buys on many launches. Using this shotgun approach on a high-gas chain like ETH (Ethereum) eats your potential ROI. Cheap transaction costs on the other hand democratize the market, meaning small players can join, and move in and out of coins quickly.","At up to 65,000 tps (transactions per second), Solana enables near-instant trading, reducing delays in high-volume markets. The faster you move and earlier you are, the larger your potential returns can be. This is where trading bots come in clutch.","The Solana network keeps gaining mindshare and transaction volume. This drives developers to build on the chain. Constantly expanding the ecosystem—including decentralized exchanges (DEXs), onchain exchanges (OEXs like Trojan's terminal), trading bots, crypto wallets, and developer tools—provides opportunities for new projects and innovative features to come online, driving more transaction volume.","There are three main groups when it comes to memecoins:","These people create tokens, launching coins and projects through smart contracts or launchpads. Some are legit, they have an idea and a vision and will work hard to drive adoption through viral marketing, building an active community, and seeking strategic partnerships. Some are serial ruggers, selling stacks of bundled coins at the first red candle. If you can find a good development team, following their work and holding their coins can be a high-IQ move.","“Believers”, “Diamond Hands”, \"Crypto Investors\", they buy and hold through 90+% swings in price because they see a long-term win. This strategy is best for early adopters. A sniper, like Trojan, is your friend.","The gunslingers of crypto—high-speed decisive gurus. They buy low, sell high, and accumulate profits. For them, a few seconds delay in decision and execution separates winning from losing. They need the most powerful tools, the fastest results, and the real-time data that only Trojan’s terminal excels at providing.","In its purest sense, memecoins are about community support. The larger and more devoted the crypto community for that coin is, the more they will spread the message about their meme, their coin, and their group and the greater the price increase.","Social media platforms like X/Twitter, Telegram, and TikTok tend to be the current source for the majority of meme coin launches. Keeping an eye out for new narratives, big events, and humorous or strange occurrences is a great way to find potential sources of new launches. The best thing about operating with an onchain toolset like Trojan is that traders can enter into the new launches the instant they become aware of them instead of waiting for a centralized crypto exchange to pick them up.","The best memecoin traders and hodlers know that the earlier you are, the bigger the potential win and that meme culture moves fast. But with the volume of launches, a buyer also needs to be discerning. It used to be that you could find any dog-themed meme coin launch and there would be a lag before they got popular, but the landscape and time-frame has changed.","Coins now go from zero to tens of millions in marketcap in an hour or less with a little social media buzz. An early buy in $TRUMP could have been one of the best investment decisions of your life, it went to a $16B market capitalization in less than 24 hours.","With Trojan’s proprietary data streams you can know immediately when major events happen: new liquidity pools created (i.e. Solana token launches), tokens burned, tokens migrated, and more. Trojan’s terminal is designed to close the gaps between knowledge, decision, and execution.","Buying meme coins in the Solana ecosystem is simple, everyone wants your business. But the question should always be, is this the best place to trade? Here are the most common methods:","Jupiter / Raydium / Serum / Orca: anything created on a launch platform won't be found here until after bonding and migration.","These can be difficult to navigate. The UIs are complicated. It is hard to execute orders quickly, and it is easy to get sandwiched by an MEV bot (which results in a bad trade).","Coinbase / Kraken / Binance / Etc: some Solana memecoins eventually get listed on major exchanges, increasing their accessibility.","By the time meme coins land in a CEX they normally have massive market valuations and the truly life-changing gain opportunities are usually long gone.","Phantom Wallet / Solflare / Etc: trading can be done directly through non-custodial wallets, but in actuality these just route your trade through the above-mentioned DEXs and pocket a fee. They give you slower speeds, poorer execution, and no control over anything but simple buys and sells.","The powerhouse of memecoin trading, Trojan takes the best parts of the systems that came before, eliminates the confusion, simplifies the execution, and provides the fastest, most accurate routing on Solana.","Trojan provides:","Easy to navigate UI","Familiar charting and tools","Simple and safe buys and sells","Limit and stop-loss orders","Copy trading","MEV protection","A DCA bot","Token audits","Lightning-fast transaction speed","A convenient and user-friendly platform","You can learn about a coin, get instant metrics, and buy it, all in one smooth motion.","Memecoins represent the perfect synthesis of fun and financial opportunity, making them one of the most popular slices of the crypto market pie. Successfully trading them requires attention, decisiveness, and a good stream of information. But for some, it's not really about trying to make insane returns. For some, it's about having a good time with friends, cracking jokes, and building community.","As the ecosystem continues to grow, Solana memecoin trading will almost certainly follow suit. New titans will rise, old ones will fall away. But, if there’s anything the market has taught us, it is that there will always be new narratives and with them new opportunities to make that one life-changing trade.","Whether you’re a seasoned degen or a first-time clicker, memecoins are where dopamine hits hardest and the gains can change your life.

The move strengthens Solana’s position as a hub for onchain markets and expands the opportunity set for traders.","January 21, 2026 — In a major step forward for real-world asset tokenization, Ondo Finance officially launched its Ondo Global Markets platform on Solana today. The rollout brings over 200 tokenized U.S. stocks, ETFs, commodities, and bonds directly onto Solana’s high-speed blockchain, giving traders onchain exposure to TradFi markets.","The announcement, shared via Ondo’s official channels and echoed across Solana’s developer and DeFi communities, positions the network as a central player in the next phase of financial evolution where Wall Street-grade products meet blockchain-native infrastructure.","Ondo’s new listings include tokenized versions of:","U.S. stocks across major sectors like tech, AI, energy, and finance","ETFs including market indexes, sector-specific, and leveraged products","Commodities such as gold, oil, and metals","U.S. Treasuries and corporate bonds","These assets are backed 1:1 by securities held by regulated U.S. broker-dealers.

This enables instant settlement and integration with DeFi protocols for lending, hedging, and portfolio management.","The launch makes Solana a premier venue for tokenized TradFi products. Traders can now hold, trade, and deploy equity exposure alongside stablecoins and memecoins within the same environment. Ondo’s integration leverages Solana’s strengths: sub-second settlement, negligible fees, and millions of daily active users via wallets like Phantom.","The move follows Ondo’s prior deployments on Ethereum and BNB Chain, both of which saw rapid adoption and hundreds of millions in total value locked. Bringing this model to Solana unlocks scalability and composability across DeFi markets.","Community response has been strong, with posts across X describing it as “Solana’s Wall Street moment.” Analysts expect the launch to accelerate RWA adoption and attract new institutional liquidity.","The offering is aimed primarily at qualified non-U.S. investors with full KYC and AML requirements. Tokens represent real securities rather than synthetics and operate under regulated custody. Ondo’s expansion aligns with global tokenization trends including South Korea’s security token amendments and U.S. pilot programs from DTCC and NYSE.","For Trojan users, the expansion of tokenized equities and funds on Solana marks another step toward a unified onchain market. As more real-world assets move onto decentralized rails, traders gain access to deeper liquidity and more complex strategies — all without surrendering custody or control. Trojan’s terminal is built for this environment, where data, speed, and composability converge.","Ondo’s deployment on Solana signals more than another integration.

The SKR token powers the Solana Mobile ecosystem with staking, governance, and user incentives through April 2026.","January 22, 2026 — Solana Mobile has begun the long-awaited SKR airdrop, rewarding Seeker smartphone owners and app developers for their participation in Season 1 of the Solana Mobile ecosystem. The airdrop began on January 21 and is one of the largest consumer-based distributions ever completed on Solana.","The SKR token is the native governance and utility asset of the Seeker ecosystem, which powers Solana’s Web3 smartphones and dApp store. It has a total supply of 10 billion SKR, with roughly 2 billion tokens allocated to airdrops and early unlocks for verified participants.","Eligible Seeker users can claim SKR directly through the Seed Vault Wallet on their phones. The process requires about 0.015 SOL in network fees, and users have until April 20, 2026, to complete their claim. Any unclaimed tokens will be returned to the airdrop pool after the window closes.","Rewards were distributed based on engagement levels, with user tiers ranging from Sovereign (up to 750,000 SKR) to Scout (around 5,000 SKR). Average user allocation reports range from 10k-40k, while inactive accounts may net no rewards. In addition, 188 developers who released verified apps to the Solana dApp Store received allocations, often at the Sovereign level.","Claimed tokens can be staked directly within the wallet or at stake.solanamobile.com to earn rewards and participate in future governance proposals. Current APY numbers clock in around 25%, though those are early numbers, and staking supports the Guardians network validators.","The SKR token launched with heavy volume and, like any big launch, some sharp moves. Early trading opened around $0.006 to $0.01 and climbed more than 60 percent in the first hours to highs near $0.015 to $0.017. Trading activity remains strong on exchanges such as Bybit and MEXC.","At present, SKR is trading at over $0.05, with active staking participation visible across DeFi dashboards like Jupiter Mobile. Some early holders have reported unrealized gains from $400 to over $1,800 based on allocation size and timing. Floating claims of “easy $30k” are clickbait.","The SKR airdrop is designed to reward real participation rather than passive farming. It recognizes both device ownership and genuine ecosystem involvement. This marks a large step forward in how Web3 projects can merge hardware and blockchain incentives.","The launch seemed to briefly bolster sentiment across Solana markets, with SOL gaining around 4 percent in the hours following the event. Season 2 of the Seeker program is now live with expanded app rewards and deeper integrations across DeFi and gaming.","Solana Mobile’s approach with SKR connects digital identity, hardware, and liquidity in a single environment, creating new opportunities for analytics and execution. The Solana Mobile SKR airdrop remains active until April 20, 2026.","Like any Solana-based token, SKR has been available for trading and had live token data tracking available on our platform since the moment it launched.

Combine that speed of action with unceasing change in technology and tool builders have to develop furiously or risk their user base moving to someone else. The driving force of trading tools now are web-based, non-custodial trading platforms.","For a time, crypto had a sea of competition, the tides of who would rule flowed back and forth constantly. The battle has now largely died and only a few platforms remain relevant to the discussion.","This will be the third in a short series of stacking the competition up against Trojan’s terminal. As always, we aim to be as honest and objective as possible by providing pros and cons, on both sides so that you can make the best decision for where to engage in your trading activity.","Today it’s Photon. Time to light the fires.","Originally coming into existence in early 2022, Tiny Astro (the creators of Photon) launched as an NFT data aggregating and monitoring platform. They launched a membership benefits NFT collection themselves during the same year, though the collection has since fallen into near flatline trading territory.","The following year, 2023, Tiny Astro launched Photon, their Solana web-based trading platform. While they subsequently expanded out into providing trading on other chains, we will be focusing strictly on Solana activity for this article.","Photon charges the standard industry rate of 1% per completed transaction. There are no cashback incentives.","Retaining users, especially in such a dynamic environment as crypto, requires one of three things generally: free stuff, features that are unique or superior to those found elsewhere, or user comfort/loyalty. So let’s take a look and see if we can find what retains their users.","First a quick note though, we’re not covering the basic stuff here, like do they have limit orders or wallet trackers. Unless they are lacking “standard equipment” or it is somehow poorly executed we don’t mention it. We expect that you expect it should be there.","Photon has a feature they refer to as Autospeed. Essentially, when enabled, their system will automatically adjust the priority and bribe amounts based upon recently processed transactions. The idea being that you can have a better shot at successful fills, while not burning gas unnecessarily. This feature is largely outdated for all but the most novice of users today. The Solana network has matured, and when speed really matters the cost of gas usually doesn’t to traders.","One of the long-standing complaints with the vast majority of webapp trading terminals has been that they are poorly organized, crowded, and sometimes downright ugly. No trader wants to spend their days staring at a brutalized interface while attempting to battle it out in the trenches. Trading is hard enough. Photon’s colors and gradients are easy on the eyes and the layout is so open it verges on feeling vacant at times. It’s a matter of taste, but severely stripping down the data display can hurt quality, rapid decision making.","With the introduction of Pumpfun’s Mayhem mode, sometimes traders are just looking to see when the chaos will end before entering. Photon provides both a large warning and a countdown timer until the close of mayhem on the coin’s chart interface. This can be beneficial, more data helps, but frankly, Mayhem doesn’t seem to have much life left. We see the value of the timer as minimal at best.","This gets a mention because, while we consider DCA Orders to be a basic piece of the puzzle when it comes to trading, almost no one has it except us. Well, Photon has included the function. And while the inclusion is positive, the execution falls short of useful. The button to even create a DCA order is practically hidden, and while it provides the ability to create a marketcap range for the DCA, without direct on-chart displays it requires users to memorize and manually enter the range. It’s almost as though it’s designed to be difficult to use.","Just because a platform is able to offer the basics tolerably well, doesn’t mean that they don’t have gaps in development or areas where they completely drop the ball. Photon’s got their own faults. Let’s talk about some.","This one is honestly kind of astonishing. Photon has a referral system. If you refer other users to come and trade on Photon you get…wait for it…points. What do these points do you ask? To date, nothing. There is no bonus, no fee sharing, nothing. Just the endless accrual of points to the user and fees to Photon.","It’s become almost standard industry practice at this point to provide a Cashback incentive to users. Similar to a rakeback in poker, it’s the house returning a portion of the fees the user has paid back to them. This, indirectly, is also a way of decreasing the fee costs for trading on the platform. Without this all traders, regardless of volume and use, are paying 1% per transaction.","Photon has a function called Autosell. However, unlike Trojan’s Autosell, they require that you create an order for every single token you buy and it has to be created inside the trade panel for that token. Additionally, there is only one Take-Profit and one Stop-Loss in their Autosell. Photon is essentially just creating a one-click dual limit order button. Not at all like Trojan’s Autosell automation.","We’ve mentioned the idea of a set of basic tools. One of the most powerful ones in onchain trading that you can’t even get on CEXs is Copy-Trading. Being able to find a wallet that is skilled at getting alpha or being early to new metas or runners is a clutch method for making it big in the Trenches. You can’t watch another trader’s wallet all the time and you can’t click faster than the engine can react for you.","An X-Tracker on-platform is designed to serve two purposes: remove the requirement to endlessly refresh and search by providing a rolling curated feed and to eliminate user need to swap between platforms to take action on news/metas/alpha/etc. Photon provides the curated rolling feed, but keeps their X-Tracker on a completely separate tab from their trading area. This means a user needs to be on that tab already (instead of on a trading tab) and then they need to move to a trading tab and try to find the associated launch. Crypto moves too fast for those kinds of delays anymore.","We could detail many more issues here:","Photon only gives the ability to change your custom reflink once, ever","You can only get your private key once, meaning if you don’t capture it or accidentally misplaced it, you can never export the wallet (imagine if Photon ever went down permanently…)","The fact that their system flags bribe amounts of less that 0.012 SOL as too low. (It’s no wonder redditors complained at great length about their portfolio’s disappearing in fees and slippage with Photon.)","The incomplete integration of DEXs and Launchpads. New platforms are constantly being released, which means a constant need to update to stay current and there are several that are not supported..","Trojan’s terminal is the next level of onchain trading brought to you by the same core team behind Trojan on Solana. We have taken everything we learned through the building and development of the most popular Telegram trading bot in crypto and funneled that knowledge into this new Onchain Exchange (OEX).","Trojan also charges a flat 1% fee on all completed trades, but there are cashback and rewards incentives that diminish that net cost for users considerably.","As usual, we’re going to try and hit the high points in reverse order from the way they were presented for Photon, speak about where we fill in the gaps they leave behind and vice versa.","One thing that can always be said about Trojan is that we believe in shared growth. Without our users, we don’t succeed and it’s why we work so hard to give back. Our entire model is to build tools that help you win. The Arena is the next evolution of Trojan’s rewards and referral program. Not only have we kept the 5-tier referral network we pioneered, but we provide generous cashback and referral percentages. Plus we turned the whole thing into a very cool game-like experience AND added a Jackpot that gives you a shot at winning 10% of the entire fee pool the Trojan platform makes every day. There’s really nothing like it.","As mentioned in previous blogs, to the active trader, there are few tools as useful as Autosell. With proper presets, Autosell allows a user to predetermine the risk profile they are willing to assume for their trades before they ever click the green button and, in truth, a trader could never have to manually click the “sell” button again. Autosell allows you to predetermine where your Stop-Loss and Take-Profit levels are for your trades and, when activated, will automatically place those levels the instant you click buy. Trojan allows for multiple levels for both SLs and TPs and you can easily make it global for all trades. No need for individual token activation.","Trojan has built the X-Tracker the way it was meant to be. Able to me moved, docked next to the actual trading interface, or opened in a separate window. Our X-Tracker is right where you need it, when you need it, and provides exceptional filtering and customization options to keep Trojan users at the bleeding edge of the newest trends.","DCA and Limit Order are at the heart of many trading strategies. We don’t want to hide them, or make them difficult to navigate. You’re already trying to make decisions quickly, the last thing you need is to have to hunt for how to enact a simple order. So we put them right where it’s most obvious. And we built the system so you can move your orders around at will on the chart or shift the DCA range for your buys/sells. Our UI/UX makes creating and editing orders an absolute breeze.","We have copy-trading. Photon doesn’t.","We have a watchlist. Photon doesn’t.","Trojan doesn’t gatekeep your private keys from you. We are non-custodial. Our users can export their wallets at will, they belong to you.","While we may suggest reasonable fees for trading, our routing is so streamlined outside of the most volatile situations gas and tip can be scaled way down and still result in accurate completed trades. Because of this variability Trojan provides easy access quick swap customizable gas/tip profiles per wallet, so users can scale their costs way down for stable non-volatile assets and up for fresh launches.","Photon only allows withdrawals to the signup wallet.","Photon doesn’t have a Consolidate function to allow funds to be drawn together from multiple wallets to one in a single transaction","And on.","No platform is without any room to improve. So let’s take a moment to reflect on where we might be missing something Photon provides.","Trojan does not currently provide a system that will automatically adjust your gas and/or priority tip for you. We can understand how this might be a benefit for the most novice users learning to trade onchain, but there are two primary reasons we see this as unnecessary. Firstly, it takes only a very small amount of trial and error to gauge appropriate settings. Second, we’ve provided quick adjustment options for switching costs. But could this be a useful feature in some kind of simple mode for the novice, essentially abstracting away the need to expend thought on it? Maybe in a future update.","No one size fits all. It’s one of the reasons we build so much customization into Terminal. We want our users to operate in the environment that fits them best. We also know that with our users attempting to make high-value decisions in seconds or less, having instantly-digestible information immediately available can make the difference between massive wins and significant losses. To that end we scrutinized over every detail, every button, every icon, displaying the most necessary data where it was necessary and making less necessary, but useful data available with very little navigation. Some may say we have too much, others too little, but we think the vast majority will find it balanced just right.","Trojan provides pretty thorough and easily accessible information in our Wallet Analyzer interface. We give PnLs, trades, win/loss ratios, etc. etc. too much to really list out. But we don’t have a feature that allows you to have all that activity overlaid directly on a calendar display. UPDATE: We have a PnL Calendar now.","If it sounds like this is reaching, it’s because it is. There is genuinely very little, if anything, of significance that Photon has better than Trojan’s Terminal when it comes to trading on Solana.","Although at this point you’re probably thinking it’s a foregone conclusion, you might as well read the last few comments because you’re already here and you might be a little surprised.","Do we think that we are the best choice for traders on Solana? Yes, unquestionably. If we didn’t think we were the best choice we would be building differently. However, there may be one particular type of user that would find Photon useful. The absolute onchain trading novice as a stepping stone to moving on to Trojan.","With its simplified interface and gentle color palette, if a user were to ignore Photon’s warnings and scale their fees way way down, and if they only traded more established marketcap coins, and didn’t put too much in, then it might be a good place to get your feet wet before moving into a platform that is both rewarding and current with the requirements of the market.","But honestly, for all that, if you’ve ever used a CEX, you might as well move directly to Trojan, save some money on fees, have some fun, and learn a platform you can use for life.","Here’s a chart:","Trojan","Photon","Want Copy Trading","X","Want (real) Autosell","Want easy-to-use DCA","Want Autospeed","Want the Broadest Referral Circle","Want Comprehensive Documentation","Want a PNL Calendar","Want a Watchlist","Want a Referral Program that Rewards","Want Cashback","This just really isn’t much of a neck and neck race. There is a lot that we never even got to covering here like perps or direct-USD1 trading integration among many many others.","Trojan’s terminal is a premier onchain platform from one of the most respected and established teams in crypto. And while we are not done improving and building, we believe that Trojan offers an unmatched experience that is the best in the industry.","With Bitcoin roots stretching back to 2016 and “full‑time” status since 2021, Silo blends data‑driven writing with cryptonative expertise.

The Clarity Act remains gridlocked, Solana’s RWA adoption hit new highs, and fresh policy from South Korea to Belarus pushed tokenization and crypto banking into the mainstream.","In the U.S., officials confirmed that 57.5 BTC seized from the Samourai Wallet case will join federal holdings under Executive Order 14233, expanding the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve to between 200K-300K BTC. The move reinforces Bitcoin’s emerging role as a sovereign reserve asset rather than a forfeited commodity, signaling growing institutionalization at the national level.","In Asia, South Korea finalized significant amendments to its Capital Markets Act and Electronic Securities Act on January 15, establishing a formal legal framework for tokenized securities. These revisions, often referred to as the country’s “STO framework,” enable regulated issuance, distribution, and trading of tokenized debt and equity instruments using blockchain technology. Law set to take effect in January 2027 following a one-year implementation window. Analysts project the domestic tokenized securities market could exceed 370 trillion won (~$249 billion USD) by 2028, positioning South Korea as a global leader in digital asset integration with traditional finance.","Meanwhile, Belarus enacted Decree No. 19, establishing regulated cryptobanks within its High-Tech Park to bridge digital asset services with traditional finance. The framework allows fiat–crypto conversions, custody, and lending under dual oversight from the National Bank and the HTP administration. This positions Belarus as a regional hub for hybrid fintech innovation. Moldova followed with early steps toward comprehensive crypto legislation slated for 2026, signaling broader Eastern European adoption of tokenization and digital asset regulation.","Together, these developments illustrate the global expansion of onchain finance. Strategic Bitcoin reserves, regulated tokenized securities, and emerging crypto banking models each contribute to the growing institutional foundation of tokenized markets worldwide.","Crypto markets entered a corrective phase, with total capitalization near 3.21 trillion dollars and trading volumes around 160 billion. Bitcoin tested lows around $92,000.","Broader sentiment remains supported by ETF inflows, macro liquidity expectations, and the growing role of sovereign digital asset holdings such as the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.","Momentum around the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act stalled through the weekend as lawmakers continued negotiations. Coinbase’s withdrawal of support left the bill’s path uncertain, citing major issues over DeFi restrictions, stablecoin yield prohibitions, and expanded SEC control at the expense of the CFTC.","The delay underscores a widening divide between traditional finance and onchain markets. With the Senate markup still pending, U.S. crypto policy remains in limbo even as the SEC retreats from enforcement-heavy tactics and drops several legacy cases. Market participants view the outcome as pivotal for stablecoin regulation, tokenized assets, and exchange oversight through 2026.","Solana’s ecosystem maintained relative stability. Real-world asset tokenization on Solana reached a record one billion dollars in total value locked, marking the network’s strongest RWA growth since mid-2025. Mithril’s full node deployment added further decentralization, while Ondo Finance prepared to launch SWEEP perpetuals.","Trojan’s terminal reflected a consistent meme coins surge in activity, while InfoFi-related tokens sold off sharply following the X announcement by Nikita Bier. Retail participation persisted, hinting at continued speculative rotation as broader markets consolidate.","The past week’s correction has not shaken the broader trajectory toward institutionalization and tokenization. Strategic Bitcoin reserves, Solana’s RWA expansion, and national frameworks in South Korea and Belarus reflect the steady migration of finance onchain.","For traders navigating this transition, Trojan continues to provide unmatched visibility into Solana markets, token flows, and real-time analytics, providing the necessary tools to turn market structure evolution into actionable opportunity.","With Bitcoin roots stretching back to 2016 and “full‑time” status since 2021, Silo blends data‑driven writing with cryptonative expertise.

The initial rollout will begin in Switzerland. UBS aims to expand to Asia-Pacific and the U.S. once regulations permit. The move puts UBS alongside firms like BlackRock in giving regulated crypto access to wealthy investors.","Hardware wallet maker Ledger is reportedly preparing a $4 billion IPO on the NYSE, enlisting Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, and Barclays as underwriters. The listing could come later this year, representing one of the largest public debuts for a crypto-native company. Ledger secures more than $100 billion in digital assets.","PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) released its Global Crypto Regulation Report 2026, calling institutional crypto integration “irreversible.” The study finds banks and asset managers are shifting from exploring crypto to implementing it as part of daily operations, especially stablecoins and tokenized funds. Regional growth is strongest in Asia and Europe, where frameworks are clearer.","SuperState, the tokenization startup founded by Compound creator Robert Leshner, has raised $82.5 million in Series B funding led by Bain Capital Crypto and Distributed Global. The firm plans to expand tokenized securities infrastructure through its Opening Bell platform on Solana and Ethereum. With more than $1.2 billion in tokenized AUM, SuperState focus is real-world asset (RWA) tokenization.","Solana reached a new record of roughly $60 billion in staked SOL, representing 70 percent of its circulating supply. Platforms like Jito and Marinade have helped drive this milestone, strengthening network security and signaling long-term holder confidence. The surge underscores Solana’s continued leadership in staking and DeFi adoption, even amid market corrections.","A new class-action lawsuit has been filed against Pump.fun, Solana Labs, and the Solana Foundation, alleging “rigged casino” mechanics and insider trading advantages. The filing includes RICO claims and private communications suggesting users were misled about fairness and MEV exposure. The case could shape how onchain launchpads manage transparency and influence memecoin market behavior going forward.","Kansas lawmakers introduced Senate Bill 352, proposing a state-managed Bitcoin reserve fund backed by unclaimed crypto assets rather than direct purchases. The bill aims to recognize digital assets as state property and allocate staking rewards and airdrops to public funds. Kansas joins Texas and New Hampshire in exploring sovereign Bitcoin reserves.","Hanwha Asset Management, one of South Korea’s largest financial institutions, signed a strategic partnership with the Solana Foundation to expand blockchain education, develop Solana-based ETPs, and design institutional custody standards. This partnership connects Solana’s technology with Hanwha’s $100B+ in managed assets, reinforcing Solana’s institutional presence in Asia’s booming digital markets.","Institutional entry continues to define 2026. From UBS’s crypto trading rollout to Ledger’s IPO and PwC’s acknowledgment of irreversible adoption, traditional finance and blockchain are converging fast. On Solana, new partnerships and products like Hanwha’s MOU shows that onchain infrastructure is evolving at the same pace as capital.","With access, execution, and insight rapidly moving fully onchain, the future increasingly looks to be a complete reshaping of how people interact with markets.

We explain why a token can be up in USD but down in SOL, how relative performance creates that difference, and why Trojan shows both views so traders can properly evaluate opportunity cost.","Congrats, Anon. You bought a token, came back, checked the charts, and it went up! But wait, when you load Trojan and check your SOL PNL, it’s red. What happened? Welcome to the wonderful world of “trading pairs”.","First things first. You made a gain. Take a moment and enjoy the sensation before moving to the next (negative) logical thought. You might have made more if you had just stayed in SOL.","You’re confused. Your trencher buds are all saying “It’s just SOL PNL dude.” “SOL cranked more than your token!” “SOL’s running right now, bro.”","You don’t understand, but that’s okay. Everyone has to learn at some point and that’s what today’s article is about. Let’s break it down.","A crypto trading pair is essentially two assets you're swapping for each other. Say you’re using SOL to buy COOLCOIN in a COOLCOIN/SOL pair. Each token has its own dollar value that constantly changes, so the values of the two can, and will, change independently of one another.","So instead of just two assets, SOL and COOLCOIN, really we have three. SOL, COOLCOIN, and USD. And each of them has a value relative to the other if you wanted to trade them:","# of SOL per 1 USD","# of COOLCOIN per 1 SOL","# of COOLCOIN per 1 USD","And each of those could be flipped the other way around as well with basic math. So if it’s 200 USD per 1 SOL, it’s 0.005 SOL per 1 USD (i.e. 1/200th of a SOL).","OK. Now that the basic idea of a pair is there, let’s circle back a little.","The native cryptocurrency of the Solana blockchain, SOL is fast and cheap for trading. It’s also needed as the \"gas\" you pay to transact in that ecosystem. But more than that, SOL becomes your trading capital for buying Solana-based tokens. You're not “holding” dollars anymore; you're “holding” SOL and are therefore now exposed to its price swings relative to USD.","How did you get your SOL to begin with? It didn’t fall off the Solana tree (I wish). You used your fiat on-ramp of choice, sent USD from your bank, and swapped it for SOL. For the sake of example, let’s say you spent $1,000 and SOL was priced at $200 USD at the time, so you got 5 SOL (ignoring fees for simplicity).","From here, you spot a promising token, like the aforementioned COOLCOIN, trading at $1 each. You swap your stack of SOL for COOLCOIN. This is effectively a bet that the price of COOLCOIN will rise against the dollar faster than SOL will.","But remember, you measured your original entry in USD, so if COOLCOIN goes up, and you check your PNL later, you’re tracing back to that FIAT starting line. You want to look at it because your USD PNL feels like the \"true\" gain. It's what you can cash out to buy pizza with. But it’s only half the story.","PNL, or Profit and Loss, is the way Trojan shows how your trade performed. But there are two entries. One is in USD and the other is in SOL.","The “difference” comes when these two metrics don’t agree, like when your USD PNL is green, but your SOL PNL is red.","Let’s break it down with your trade. You spent 5 SOL to buy 1,000 COOLCOIN at 0.005 SOL each (we are assuming this trade was made immediately after buying your SOL with USD).","Time passes…SOL’s price jumped to $300, and COOLCOIN also went up and it hit $1.30. Here comes the math. Brace yourself.","USD PNL: Your 1,000 COOLCOIN is now worth 1,000 × $1.30 = $1,300. You started with $1,000 worth of SOL, so you’re up $300. Green!","SOL PNL: Your 1,000 COOLCOIN is worth $1,200, but SOL is now $300 each. Divide $1,200 by $300/SOL, and you get 4 SOL—less than your original 5 SOL. Red!","This difference happens because SOL outpaced COOLCOIN. While COOLCOIN gained value in USD, SOL’s price grew even faster, so your trade is worth fewer SOL than you started with.","Here’s a quick visual to make it crystal clear:","Stage","SOL Price","COOLCOIN Price","COOLCOIN Value (USD)","COOLCOIN Value (SOL)","Initial Trade","$200","$1 (0.005 SOL)","$1,000 (1000 COOLCOIN)","5 SOL","After Price Change","$300","$1.30 (0.004 SOL)","$1,300 (1000 COOLCOIN)","4 SOL","PNL","+$300 (green)","-1 SOL (red)","The USD vs. SOL PNL difference shines a light on “opportunity cost” (we’ll cover this in another blog) by showing how your trade stacks up against simply holding SOL.","In essence, it gives you a fuller view of the trading pair's two-sided nature, helping you spot whether your token is truly outperforming or just riding SOL’s wake.","Trojan displays both PNLs for exactly this reason: to let you evaluate your position from multiple angles.","But there is good news. It doesn't always matter that much.","A green USD PNL is often all you need. Disparities are usually noticed during big market shifts, like in our example when SOL blasts up suddenly. But price gaps are usually not so rapidly extreme. The differences can be subtle but, when they add up over a long period, jarring.","It’s worth noting that things can also swing the other way too, (i.e. where your token outpaces SOL).  It takes some time to wrap your head around this. But once you get it, you’ll get it.","There you have it, anon. Trading pairs aren't out to get you; they're just showing the full picture. Next time you see green USD and red SOL, enjoy the win, before you ask: \"Could I have won bigger?\"","No one is born knowing this stuff. Your trench bros probably learned it the hard way, after a few painful trades. But Trojan wants to help you avoid that route, and instead pick up the skills without the pain.","If you find yourself still confused after reading this and giving it a go, you can always find assistance in our 24/7 Help Chat.","So go forth, trade wisely with Trojan, and may your PNLs always trend green, whichever way you measure 'em.","Posted By","Follow on X","Trading Pair PNLs or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Difference","Arena Dispatch #005: Davos Crypto Spotlight, Solana Memecoin Frenzy, Firedancer Goes Live, & Market Volatility","Global crypto markets remain volatile as Davos reinforces institutional adoption narratives while Solana continues to outperform in onchain activity.

Our comparison breaks down performance, design, and reliability. See why Trojan’s precision, clarity, and feature-depth give users the upper hand.","Success in onchain crypto trading is about one thing: an edge. And because the market always evolves, infrastructure providers need to iterate or risk their user base moving elsewhere. Today’s powerhouse trading tools are web-based, non-custodial trading platforms.","For a season, the space was flooded by competitors battling it out for supremacy. The warzone has diminished drastically, and now only a handful of interfaces are even worth considering.","This will be the first in a short series placing the competition up against Trojan’s terminal. We’re aiming to be as honest and objective as possible by providing pros and cons, on both sides so that you can make the best decision for where to engage in your trading activity.","We’re starting with Axiom. Let’s get in the trenches.","Axiom was originally launched by Henry Zhang and Preston Ellis in February of 2025 as a Y Combinator startup. Since inception their volume ticked up until May of 2025, when it peaked at just under a half-billion dollars of single day volume. Since then, volume has dropped dramatically to between $100-300 million. Daily active users and daily total trades have also slowed considerably. This could point to a slow down in the Solana ecosystem as a whole, however it may also be indicative of users not finding what they are looking for with Axiom.","Axiom charges a flat 1% fee on all trade executions, though there are cashback incentives which we will cover in the next section which shift the net cost of trading with their platform.","We’re going to check off some of the interesting features of Axiom. They will be curated to things that either seem unique or of likely interest to users. It’s not a comprehensive list of features and we don’t plan to cover most of the stuff that is just standard tooling, like limit orders and adjustable slippage.","They are working with a yield provider in order to offer “passive income”. The claim is a variable APY (a little under 9% at the time of writing) on staked USDC. Some might see this as an excellent opportunity to skim a little extra off of their idle cash holdings. This one could probably fall both ways. You would really only want to make use of this if you are bearish SOL, otherwise you miss out on the upside native gains.","Twitter trackers have become practically standard equipment. Socials are a leading avenue for discovering metas and catching alpha, so instantly feeding in posts from select or top accounts can mean the difference between catching a good entry and missing significant profits. Axiom’s X Tracker provides a little extra edge by making it customizable, but it only lets you pick from a list of 1500 Axiom provided accounts. It does not allow you to compile a completely customized list of Twitter accounts.","Pumpfun has made a big deal out of the livestreaming movement. As such, they have a whole category of their platform dedicated to coins that are tied to livestreaming. Axiom has a dedicated section of their platform for these coins. All well and good, but this is essentially just a glorified filter. You cannot view the livestream from within the Axiom platform itself, you still have to go to Pump for that.","Axiom’s Vision tab essentially serves the purpose of a filtered leaderboard. You can see a most winning traders list of KOLs, of all Axiom traders, and of wallets you have chosen to track. The benefits to this feature are certainly two-sided. On the one hand, users might be able to find some good wallets to track and copy trade (if that were a feature…) and on the other the KOLs see benefits by collecting clout to gain more social credit.","There are a handful of other pieces that may or may not be of interest which we won’t detail but merely mention:","They have a beta turbo mode, which is a nonce account that auto-adjusts priority and bribe values.","Re-use of image counter","Custom RPC and server selector","Many token filtering options","In a similar vein to the set of pros above, we’re going to provide some detail on issues that may either be of concern for users, or even potentially deal-breakers, depending on what you are looking to get out of a trading platform.","Before we fully dive into this, we have to mention Axiom’s documentation. While not a mess, doing research for this blog was made far more difficult by the lack of adequate detail. A number of features are either barely mentioned or are completely missing forcing users to either figure it out themselves or pester the discord mods for insight.","Axiom does not have copy trading, DCA, or autosell. While Autosell may be slightly more advanced, we at Trojan see copy trading and DCA as features that should be automatically included in any trading bot or trading platform for onchain activity. The whole principle behind a webapp is to be a one-stop-shop for all your needs. Requiring users to pursue a third-party app for such foundational tasks seems like poor prioritization.","Just because you can provide data on something doesn’t mean you should. In a UI which attempts to provide large volumes of instantly digestible information, finely tuned organization is essential. Axiom’s interface feels not just crowded, but at times almost haphazard, like they develop a new data stream and don’t know where to put it, so they just find empty space and inject a new icon. The communication of data is many times at least as important as having it.","Axiom has native perpetuals trading through Hyperliquid. You can run BTC at up to 40x and they have a list of around 200 assets available for trading, though a large number are quite obscure and have very little volume. However, there is no way to select between Cross Margin and Isolated, positions are always Isolated, preventing users from truly putting their balance to work. Anyone who regularly makes use of perpetuals understands the importance of having both options available.","Axiom provides only three tiers of referral rewards (30% for immediates, then 3%, then 2%). Broader networks always provide greater opportunities for passive income opportunities.","We realize that not all participants in crypto come from or even know the core pillars that launched the whole movement, but the idea of being able to transact pseudonymously was an early desire in cryptocurrency circles. While Axiom does not require users to sign up with their Google accounts or email addresses, even placing the option in front of new users sets the stage for poor privacy practices.","In order to move up the reward ranks on Axiom, which brings an increase in the cashback percentage earned, users must trade increasing volumes. The highest level of cashback a user can achieve is 0.25%. There are seven levels, but there is no place where the progression requirements are laid out plainly that we could find. Users deserve transparency.","Similar to the opaque cashback program, there is a points program that is supposed to grant users \"additional benefits and potential future rewards”. But, again, there is nothing laid out anywhere that we could find that actually tells what the rewards are or what benefits arise from earning points. We are not fans of ambiguous points programs.","There are other items which we could make note of, complaints of failed or slow transactions and loading, being logged out of sessions seemingly at random, or just general lag.","Trojan’s terminal is the next level of onchain trading brought to you by the same core team behind Trojan on Solana. We have taken everything we learned through the building and development of the most popular Telegram trading bot in crypto and funneled that knowledge into this new onchain exchange (OEX).","Trojan also charges a flat 1% fee on all completed trades, and there are cashback and rewards incentives that diminish that net cost for users.","We’re going to kind of invert things here. First we’ll discuss where Trojan’s terminal fills the gaps Axiom leaves or provides what Axiom fails to, and then in the Cons section it’s going to be vice versa.","Autosell is easily one of the most powerful tools in all of crypto and Axiom doesn’t have it. It automatically places take-profit and stoploss orders the instant a user buys a token so that portfolio risk is always predetermined and traders can focus on trading instead of watching charts.","It seems odd to even have to make mention of Copy Trading and DCA, but suffice it to say that we offer it. The interface is straight-forward, easy to access, and simple to use. You can even establish a Copy Trade directly from the wallet analysis menu.","We don’t want you guessing as to what we provide or how our products work. In order to prevent confusion we hit every detail, every feature, step-by-step. Trojan prides itself on providing in-depth communication so you don’t have to waste your time wondering.","Not only do we provide a referral program that extends out to 5 tiers of connections, but we created the first truly gamified onchain exchange rewards program: The Arena. With competitions, lotteries, earning seasons, leaderboards, season questing, and much much more, nothing else on the market even comes close. And to top it all off the progression and potentials are all transparent and immediately available with clear goalposts. No promised-but-not-delivered points systems.","Trojan, like Axiom, has integrated Hyperliquid perpetuals. Unlike Axiom, however, we have provided the ability for users to select between Isolated and Cross Margin trading. This seems like a basic decision. In our opinion, more freedom is pretty much always a better.","Massive quantities of rapid fire data is no good to you if you can’t digest it. One of the reasons the Trojan terminal’s design is superior is because we agonize over every detail. If we can’t justify the benefit to you of adding another icon, number, or progress bar, we don’t include it. No flashbangs, no casino lights. Neat, orderly, and direct communication, so you can focus on what matters.","Trojan is adamant about not collecting your personally identifiable data (PID). We don’t ask for or want your email or google account or telegram connection. The only way to sign up with us is with a wallet address or a passkey. We don’t control your PID, just like we don’t control your funds.","There are a number of other areas where Trojan’s OEX provides value that we can make brief mention of:","We show Pumpfun comments below the charts","We have holderscan and instant security audits","We provide a direct Orders page access link","Everyone has places where they can potentially improve. So let’s take an honest look at where Trojan could maybe fill things in some.","We don’t provide perps directly in the interface…yet. There’s not much to cover here. But rest assured that if/when we include leverage trading natively to the interface, it’ll be the best experience you’ll find on any platform.","In a similar vein to the above, we don’t provide native yield farming…yet. We detailed our thinking above on why this doesn’t seem to be a priority. We’re not sure if user demand for swap SOL into USDC and then locking it up in order to capture a 7-9% yield is really there. If/when we offer this feature, it will be with the most secure provider and with the best, most flexible terms possible for our users. Definitely not something done in a hurry.","While we feel that our X-Tracker is far more user-friendly and better curated than Axiom’s, we recognize that being able to completely customize the feed so that it can be tailored to each user’s preferences would be a great tool to have. We might roll this one out.","You can’t upload your own sounds or set up infinite themes or do a bunch of the other little nuanced alterations. We may offer greater levels of customization in the future, but we spent an enormous amount of time in design to make the UI comfortable and extreme individualization stood as lower priority than providing top-quality buildout. Themes may be coming in the future.","The million dollar question. Of course, most anyone reading this will think that we’re just going to recommend Trojan. Slow down. First we’re going to give an honest assessment of Axiom, and then we’ll provide recommendations, and you might be surprised.","Brass tacks on Axiom:","They have a broad user base currently","They have pushed development in many areas","Their UI feels rushed and crowded, with pieces appearing shoehorned in","Their documentation leaves users to mostly figure it out themselves","Their app lacks what we consider basic tooling","So look, if we didn’t think we were the best choice for most users, then we would be building differently. But that doesn’t mean that we’re perfect for all traders in all situations, so here’s a quick table that provides a breakdown:","Trojan","Axiom","Must Have Native Perps?","Yes","Want Copy Trading and/or DCA?","Want Autosell?","Need in-app USDC Yield?","Want the Broadest Referral Circle?","Want Comprehensive Documentation?","Need to Customize the Color Theme of the UI?","Want Clarity on Referral Program Advancement?","Frankly, we think the choice is pretty obvious. And while we covered a lot here, there are plenty of other elements we didn’t even touch, like the opportunities available for greater earning potential with a fresh referral program as opposed to trying to compete with one that has filled with so many participants already.","Trojan’s terminal is an exceptional onchain platform from a respected and established team. And while we may not have filled every crevice with bells and whistles, we believe that Trojan offers an unmatched experience that is the best in the industry.","With Bitcoin roots stretching back to 2016 and “full‑time” status since 2021, Silo blends data‑driven writing with cryptonative expertise.
